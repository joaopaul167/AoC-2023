# AoC-2023
 Advent of Code 2023

In the 2023 advent of code trials ill be using C++ to solve the problems. My goals are to write a clean and easy to understand code to solve the problems.
Using abstract and well known functions in the cost of performance.

To run the code you must have a GCC compiler

Bash script to build:
$ build.sh

Bash script to hot reload on file changes:
$ run.sh
